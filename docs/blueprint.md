## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft orange (#F7934F) to represent energy and warmth, while not being too aggressive. This can subtly convey the idea of home and cooking.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), providing a soft, neutral backdrop that doesn't distract from the primary elements. The beige also references natural gas in its unrefined state.
- Accent color: Pale green (#D3FFCE), used sparingly for key actions or information to give a modern fresh counterpoint to the more old-fashioned orange.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif), a versatile and legible font suitable for both headlines and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Simple, clear icons for navigation and actions, enhancing usability.
- Clean, organized layout with clear calls to action, making it easy for users to book cylinders and manage their accounts.
