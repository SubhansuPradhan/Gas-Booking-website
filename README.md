# Gas‑Booking Website

## 🚀 Project Overview  
The Gas‑Booking Website is a web application built to simplify the process of booking LPG / domestic gas cylinders. It allows customers to log in, book a cylinder, track status, and view past bookings; and allows the admin/distributor to manage bookings, update statuses and monitor operations.

## 🎯 Features  
- User registration and login.  
- Dashboard for customers: book a cylinder, view current order status, view past orders.  
- Admin/distributor dashboard: view all bookings, change order status (e.g., “Booked”, “Dispatched”, “Delivered”), manage users/bookings.  
- Responsive UI built with modern frontend stack.  
- Role‑based access: customer vs admin/distributor.  
- Optimized for deployment (configuration for hosting included).

## 🧰 Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: TypeScript + Next.js, styled with Tailwind CSS.  
- **Backend / API**: Next.js API routes or custom backend (if applicable).  
- **Deployment config**: apphosting.yaml included for hosting environment.  
- **Package management**: package.json + package-lock.json.  
- **Linting / TypeScript config**: tsconfig.json.  
- **Code structure**: src/ folder for frontend components, pages, etc.
